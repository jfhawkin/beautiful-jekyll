    For a project I am conducting at the University of Calgary, I require a value for average square footage of dwellings in Calgary communities.
    LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing technique utilizating laser readings to obtain the elevation of surface points.
    From this data, I could obtain a representation of building features. The height of a building can be calculated based on an average of the
    elevation readings within a building footprint and an average elevation from a buffer around the footprint representing the ground elevation.
    A summary of the method is outlined at this <a href"https://gist.github.com/YKCzoli/3605e014b8ed09a571e5"> link</a>. The necessary
    data were not available for the City of Calgary and another method was employed for the project. None the less, I wanted to experiment
    with the method. Data were available for the nearby City of Airdrie. Mapbox was used to create the visualization, in conjunction with
    postGIS and QGIS (open-source is the best).<br>
